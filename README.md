# README-templates

## 🧭 Overview
A collection of customizable **README** templates designed to speed up project documentation. Instead of writing a README from scratch every time, simply pick a template that matches your project type and adapt it to your needs.

## 📂 README Templates
### Current Templates are:
- **Research Work:**   
    Ideal for academic papers, thesis projects, datasets, or experiment-based repositories. Includes sections for methodology, experiments, citations, and reproducibility.

- **General Application:**  
    Suitable for front-end, back-end, or full-stack web projects. Covers features, tech stack, setup instructions, deployment, environment variables, and more.
